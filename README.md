# Concrete Crack Detection in Buildings
### H.N.Huy NGUYEN

This project is a part of the final assignment of the specialization that I'm currently pursuing called [**IBM AI Engineering** on Coursera]("https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer").

The project is about training a Deep Neural Network using pretrained model <code>resnet18</code> and a dataset of 40000 images of concrete samples with labels.

The aim is to understand the basic concepts of training and evaluating a Deep Neural Network, how to set up parameters for a simple NN like
<ul>
  <li>Choosing criterion, here I used <code>Cross entropy loss function</code></li>
  <li>Organize training dataset and validation dataset</li>
  <li>Choosing optimizer for the model</li>
  <li>Train the model, define the number of <code>epoch</code> and <code>batch size</code> for each training/validation loader</li>
</ul>
